DEAD CODE CLEANUP SUMMARY
=========================
Analysis Date: 2026-02-14
Codebase: Polymarket Arbitrage Bot (164 Python files)

IMMEDIATE SAFE DELETIONS (Phase 1)
===================================

1. scanner/fees_v2.py (203 lines)
   - Unused alternate fee model implementation
   - Zero references in entire codebase
   - Active file is scanner/fees.py

2. executor/maker_lifecycle.py (200+ lines)
   - GTC maker order lifecycle manager
   - Never imported anywhere
   - Incompatible with current FAK-only execution

Total Phase 1: 2 files, ~403 lines, SAFE TO DELETE

REVIEW BEFORE DELETION (Phase 2)
=================================

3. executor/cross_platform_v2.py (577 lines)
   - Unused alternate implementation (v1 is active)
   - May contain valuable improvements
   - Action: Diff against v1, backport improvements, then delete

Total Phase 2: 1 file, ~140-577 lines, MEDIUM RISK (review first)

TYPE SAFETY FIXES (Phase 3)
============================

4 instances of "# type: ignore" to fix:
1. tests/test_kalshi_cache.py:87 - frozen dataclass mutation
2. tests/test_fanatics.py:54 - frozen dataclass mutation
3. executor/safety.py:445 - dict type mismatch
4. executor/safety.py:447 - dict type mismatch

Fix: Use dataclasses.replace(), add proper type annotations

TOTAL CLEANUP POTENTIAL
=======================
- Files to delete: 3
- Lines to remove: 540-980
- Type issues to fix: 4
- Unused dependencies: 0
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments: 0
- Code duplication: None found

WHAT TO KEEP (Intentional)
===========================
- scanner/value.py - Disabled by design (documented)
- scanner/resolution.py - Active feature
- scanner/stale_quote.py - Active feature
- client/fanatics.py - Future integration (API pending)
- client/kalshi_cache.py - NEW CODE (add to git)

QUICK START COMMANDS
====================

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b refactor/dead-code-cleanup

# Phase 1: Safe deletions
git rm scanner/fees_v2.py executor/maker_lifecycle.py
uv sync --all-extras
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/ -v
git commit -m "refactor: remove unused files (403 lines)"

# Phase 2: Review v2 file
diff -u executor/cross_platform.py executor/cross_platform_v2.py | less
# Then manually backport or delete

# Phase 3: Fix type ignores
# Edit files manually
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/ -v
git commit -m "fix: improve type safety"
