# Dry-Run Opportunity Reality Report (20260216_145154)

## Run Setup

- Mode: `--dry-run` with `RECORDING_ENABLED=true`
- Window: 10-minute timeout run started on 2026-02-16 at ~14:51:58 local, stopped at ~15:01:54
- Cycles completed: **302**
- Markets scanned (cumulative): **647,790** (from runtime summary)
- Opportunity instances observed: **22615**
- Unique opportunity signatures (deep-dived): **76**
- Output artifacts: `logs/dryrun10_20260216_145154.console.log`, `report/dry_run_20260216_145154_opportunity_deep_dive.csv`, `recordings/dryrun10_20260216_145154`

## Headline Findings

- Composition: **22348 correlation** opportunities and **267 maker** opportunities.
- Dominant reason code: `corr_parent_child_buy_liquidity_weighted` (16006 instances).
- Inventory-dependent patterns (`BUY/SELL` with `sell_inventory_required`): **2718** instances; these are less immediately actionable.
- Realness score (0-100): overall mean **87.70**; correlation mean **88.18**; maker **51.80**.
- Realness tiers: High=19, Medium=6, Medium-High=10, Very High=41.
- Time-to-money proxy (median time-to-resolution): median **~4.4mo**, mean **~5.9mo**.
- Practical implication: most edges looked structurally persistent, but many likely monetize on multi-week to multi-month timelines unless you actively trade out earlier.
- Operational warnings: dry-run market cap enabled (1), CoinGecko 429 rate limit (7).

## How Real Is Each Opportunity?

Scoring method used for each signature:
- Inputs: persistence across cycles, confidence, fill probability, book depth, toxicity, realized-EV score, and profit stability.
- Penalties: inventory dependence (`SELL` legs), ultra-high ROI likely driven by tiny notional, and very thin depth.
- Interpretation: higher score = more likely executable/real in practice, not just theoretical.

## Additional Observations

- Repetition was very high: the same signatures persisted nearly every cycle, indicating structural rather than random one-off dislocations.
- Theoretical totals are not equal to realizable PnL: dry-run assumes quoted liquidity and no queue slippage; real fills may be lower.
- Maker edge was tiny (sub-$1 average signature profit) and intermittently absent; likely sensitive to queue position and microstructure noise.
- Several very high ROI signatures came from small required capital or thin books; those deserve manual depth checks before trusting headline ROI.
- `BUY/SELL` inventory-required signatures can look profitable in scans but may not be actionable without existing inventory and good basis.
